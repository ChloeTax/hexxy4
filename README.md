# hexxy4

pack downloads:

main branch: https://hexxytest.hexxy.media/packdownload/hexxy4.zip

dev branch: https://hexxytest.hexxy.media/packdownload/hexxy4-dev.zip

these packs are for [Prism](https://prismlauncher.org/), the reccomended way to import them is by pressing `add instance`, selecting `import` on the left, and pasting in the `main branch` url listed above

but you could also download the zip from that link and drag it into the prism window

if those dont work, you could also download the pack from the [releases page](https://github.com/ChloeTax/hexxy4/releases/tag/0.0.1) and drag it into prism
